# Monty Hall Problem

In some tv show is was a quize to choose one door out of three. User has a chance to get auto. Behind one of three doors there is a car, behind rest two doors were bycicles. The rules are following: user chooses the door, speaker opens one door with bycicle and asks user if he wants to choose another door, of two remaining doors. The question is: Should the user always change his choise or speaker wants to trick the user?

## Description of a process

We have a three doors A, B, C. 

- User choses to open door A, probability that car is at door A: 33%. Chance that car is somewhere in two rest doors B, C: 66%
- Speaker opens door C, where bicycle is and asks user if he wants to change his choose (for the moment A)
- Since that probability car is behind doors B, C is 66% and we know that at C there is no car, probability that car is at door B: 66%
- It worth to switch choose
